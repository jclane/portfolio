      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Justin Lane and I am a software developer from Louisville, KY.<p>
      <p>I discovered a love a coding while completing my Bachelor's degree. As a child I had enjoyed creating mods for the video games I was playing, but was always more pleased with the end result.  Now, I find I enjoy the entire process.  The planning, designing, testing, and of course the actual coding.  It's a challenge and keeps me from getting bored.<p>
